  <Description>k__BackingField: "I fell in this deep hole which ended up in a cavern.
    Everything has this really weird purple tint to it. Looks like some of the rocks
    have blood on them, I don\u2019t like it. There\u2019s also a dead scout here,
    poor bastard. I found this small thing though, I wonder what it does."
