  <Description>k__BackingField: "Hello brave explorer!\r\n\r\nAs a forward scout
    you have been tasked with performing one of the most important tasks in The Federation.
    It is your responsibility to explore distant systems to determine if they can
    become valuable members of The Federation. Below is your specific mission. Onwards,
    for the greater good!\r\n\r\nMission Statement:\r\nYou have been assigned to
    explore the planet known as \u201CEarth\u201D, located in the Milky Way. Earth
    used to be home of the human race, before the Exodus of Humans in 2277. You will
    land in a territory formerly known as the Kingdom of Denmark, in a region formerly
    known as \u201CM\xF8n\u201D. Your objective is to observe and record the state
    of the planet, to determine if it is suitable for habitation. You are to study
    the local wildlife and any local civilizations, should they exist. Since \u201CEarth\u201D
    has been abandoned by humans for a substantial period of time, it is unknown
    how the ecosystem has adjusted to this change. If you are to encounter hostile
    lifeforms, you are not to harm them as they could prove valuable to the research
    of The Federation. \r\n"
