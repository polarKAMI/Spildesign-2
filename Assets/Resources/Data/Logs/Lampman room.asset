  <Description>k__BackingField: "How did humans ever live here? This entire place
    is one big hellscape. I saw a lamppost and hoped maybe there\u2019d be someone
    near it to help me. But nope there was nobody there. Well, not nobody. The *******
    lamppost transformed into some creature and started chasing me. The light did
    something weird to me, my ears are still ringing. Maybe this is the Ignis Fatuus
    I was reading about. It looks nothing like the description, maybe it\u2019s changed
    since the Exodus. If I ever get back, I\u2019ll have to update the database."
