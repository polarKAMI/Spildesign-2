  <Description>k__BackingField: "This is interesting. I found some ruins made of
    stone. It doesn\u2019t look like any of the buildings I\u2019ve seen in old pictures,
    from before The Exodus. They must be extremely old, belonging to an ancient civilization.
    I wish I could stay longer to study them, but I gotta move on. My supplies are
    running out, I can\u2019t get hung up on these small details. I\u2019ve made
    a mark of the location, so we can return eventually. But for now I gotta move
    on, I need to find a way back to the ship. "
