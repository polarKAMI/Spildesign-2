  <Description>k__BackingField: "Something weird\u2019s going on. This forest seems
    to stretch forever, and there\u2019s barely any sunlight coming through. I found
    a ladder of some sort, which I crawled down. I then found myself in a small cave,
    with rocks protruding from everywhere. The walls, ceiling and even the floor.
    But there was nothing in here, and the cave had no other exits. I wonder who
    made that ladder. Hmmm. Maybe some kind of basic civilization has risen since
    The Exodus. I\u2019ll make sure to log this with The Federation when I get back."
