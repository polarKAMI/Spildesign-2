  <Description>k__BackingField: "Goblins, known as \u201CNisser\u201D in contemporary
    sources, are small creatures littering the countryside. According to legend,
    they take up residence in farms and small houses when they leave their natural
    homes. After the societal collapse it is assumed that most goblins moved into
    the forests where they took up homes in caves and forests as they could no longer
    rely on humans to find food. It is uncertain if goblins still exist, or if they
    went extinct after losing their main source of food. However, as a Forward Scout
    you should be on the lookout for these creatures as they can become a significant
    nuisance. If you notice waking up near a well or a lake, this could be a sign
    of a goblin in the vicinity. It is recommended to keep your distance from a goblin,
    as they are very moody and quick to anger. Goblin are also very territorial,
    and will protect their homes from intruders. Should you anger a goblin, you can
    leave a bowl of oatmeal around for it to find, as a peace offering. Note: The
    rations for this mission do not contain oatmeal.\r"
