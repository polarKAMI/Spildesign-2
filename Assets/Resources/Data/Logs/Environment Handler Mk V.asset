  <Name>k__BackingField: Environment Handler Mk V
  <Description>k__BackingField: "The Environment Handler Mk V is the latest in the
    line of Handler technology, which provides invaluable assistance to the Forward
    Scouts on their mission to expand the ideals of The Federation. The Mk V follows
    its predecessors in having the ability to shoot a large blast in front of itself.
    This blast can be used to clear out obstacles in a Scouts path, and can also
    be used in self-defense. However, this feature is only to be used in emergencies
    as the local ecosystems are not to be disturbed by a Scout. The EnHan is to be
    used primarily to scan the local environment, to determine if it is fit for habitation.
    When scanning objects, the EnHan will automatically check if something similar
    is already detected in the database, and release this information to the Scout.
    \r\n\r\nThe Mk V also includes the new Recycling technology, which allows the
    user to convert almost any item into ammunition, should the issued amount fail
    to provide enough.\r\n"
