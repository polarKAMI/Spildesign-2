  <Description>k__BackingField: "If anyone is reading this I\u2019m dead, and thank
    god for that. This place is the most dangerous place I\u2019ve heard of, everything
    is trying to kill me. The small guys trying to bash my skull in, the thing with
    the lamp that freaked out when I got near, and the goddamn rock that turned into
    a really freaky looking child and then charged at me. I\u2019ve spent all my
    ammunition, I\u2019ve got no more rations. I landed badly when I fell down there,
    I probably broke some ribs and my ankle. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s gonna find
    this, but I need to warn whoever comes down here. TURN AROUND! The Federation
    is lying to you, you\u2019re not the first Scout to come here. Hell, I\u2019m
    not even the first one. I saw some poor guy hanging from some trees a while back.
    Hope he went faster than me. "
