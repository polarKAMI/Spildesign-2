  <Description>k__BackingField: "I found this torn piece of paper on the dead Scout.
    It looks like the bottom half of a recruitment leaflet, pretty similar to the
    one I was handed all that time ago. It reads: \r\n\r\nThe Federation needs you!\r\n\r\nAs
    we continue to expand the liberty and prosperity of The Federation, we are looking
    for brave and adventurous individuals to explore exotic and distant systems.\r\nSign
    up at a recruiting station TODAY and start making a difference tomorrow.\r\n"
