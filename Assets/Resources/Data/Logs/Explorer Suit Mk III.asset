  <Description>k__BackingField: "As stated in your training programme, the Explorer
    Suit Mk III is absolutely state of the art. It is a full body survival suit,
    designed to sustain our explorers on foreign planets for up to 2 months without
    recharging. The suit has several features meant to allow for exploration in extremely
    hostile environments for sustained periods of time. The suit features a breathing
    apparatus that filters out harmful gasses, or supplements the intake with useful
    gasses such as oxygen. As an added bonus, this feature also filters out any unpleasant
    smells. The breathing apparatus will even allow for exploration of planets without
    an atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe Explorer Suit MK III is created from a steel alloy,
    which allows for excellent toughness and mobility. As such, the user should feel
    little to no restriction of movement when wearing the suit. The suit also has
    servos installed, which allows the user to wear the suit without feeling the
    weight of the suit.\r\n\r\nThe suit also contains a recorder, which allows for
    the explorer to create audio logs of their experience. When the explorer records
    a log it is automatically transcribed and saved. These logs are then shared with
    our R&D department, to create a more streamlined feedback process. Keep in mind
    swearing in these logs is against our code of conduct, and will be censored in
    the transcription. The employee will also be reprimanded. \r"
