  <Description>k__BackingField: "The Ignis Fatuus, known as Lygtemanden in contemporary
    local sources, is a creature rumoured to be stalking the bogs and swamps at night.
    Sources differ wildly in descriptions of the creature, and no sightings have
    ever been confirmed to be true. However, the creature features often in local
    sources and as such it is recommended to be on the lookout for it. The creature
    has locally been described as a short man, no larger than a child of 6 years,
    holding a lantern with a strong lightsource. However, descriptions of the creature
    vary, so the physical description might not be fully accurate. According to legend,
    the creature will light its lantern to lure travelers into bogs and swamps in
    an attempt to drown and rob these travelers. If the creature is spotted, it is
    to be observed and not harmed in accordance with the \u201CForeign System Act\u201D
    of 2674. If you are spotted by the creature, it is recommended to turn your clothes
    inside out, as this would force the creature to show you the correct way out
    of the bog. Note: The Explorer Suit MK III cannot be inverted, any attempts to
    do so will result in termination. Should the creature become hostile to you,
    it is recommended to hide as the creature is rumored to be incredibly powerful.
    According to legend, the creature will turn hostile if confronted with steel.\r"
