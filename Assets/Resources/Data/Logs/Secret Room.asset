  <Description>k__BackingField: "I finally found a way through this **** barrier.
    The key next to the dead guy allowed me through, for some reason. God this was
    a waste of time. There\u2019s nothing here! It\u2019s just an empty cave. I never
    should have accepted this mission. Luckily I found an old survival kit down here.
    Might keep me going for a little bit longer. Very helpful, if I can\u2019t avoid
    any of those monsters roaming outside."
