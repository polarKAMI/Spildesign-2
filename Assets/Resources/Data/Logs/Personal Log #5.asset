  <Description>k__BackingField: "That\u2019s it, I\u2019m done! I fell into a hole
    and I found a freaking dead scout. He\u2019s been ******* crucified! I was told
    I\u2019d be the first person here since the Exodus. I found a log on the scout,
    and some of the things he said\u2026 I don\u2019t think The Federation works
    for my benefit anymore. I gotta get out of here. Ever since I got here everything\u2019s
    been trying to kill me. **** the mission, **** The Federation. I just wanna make
    it home"
