  <Description>k__BackingField: "Okay this place is getting really freaking weird.
    I went into another cave, trying to find my way out. That was a big mistake.
    I had to crawl through a small tunnel, almost getting myself stuck in there.
    When I emerged, there was a freaking goblin there, charging me. I couldn\u2019t
    crawl back, I had to kill him. This place is really creepy. There are 2 pillars
    made of stones stacked upon each other, they have some weird symbols engraved
    and painted with something that looks an awful lot like blood. There\u2019s also
    this big slab of stone in between them, and that is definitely covered in blood.
    I really need to get out of here\r"
