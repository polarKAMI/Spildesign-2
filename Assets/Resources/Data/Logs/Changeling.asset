  <Description>k__BackingField: "A changeling, known as a \u201Cskiftling\u201D in
    contemporary sources, is a human-like creature rumored to be found throughout
    the European continent. According to legends, changelings are enchanted troll
    children left in human settlements. They take on the form of huma children, who
    are then kidnapped by the trolls. According to the lore, changelings have the
    ability to almost perfectly mimic humans, and as such can be hiding in plain
    sight. It is not known how the changelings would have reacted following the Exodus
    of Humans. The ruling opinion among modern folklorists is that changelings have
    further developed their mimicking abilities beyond just mimicking humans. It
    is possible, but not probable, that changelings can now alter their appearance
    to become anything, even inanimate objects. However, this is merely speculation
    as the existence of changelings has never been confirmed.\r\nIf one believes
    a changeling to be in the vicinity, there are methods to make them reveal themselves.
    One of these methods is brewing ale in a broken eggshell. Note: Standard scout
    equipment does not contain brewing supplies nor eggs.\r"
