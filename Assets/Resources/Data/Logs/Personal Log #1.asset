  <Description>k__BackingField: "First day officially back on Earth. I\u2019m excited
    to finally get started with my mission. The place looks a bit gloomy, but nothing
    a Scout of The Federation can\u2019t handle. I\u2019m gonna start out a little
    bit slow, can\u2019t be too cautious. Shouldn\u2019t take me too long to find
    anything of interest, the forest seems full of life. I could have sworn I saw
    someone in the trees, but it was probably just my eyes playing tricks on me. "
