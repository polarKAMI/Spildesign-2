  <Description>k__BackingField: "Second day of my mission. I think I might be in
    trouble. I wanted to return to the ship to resupply, but I fell down a hillside
    and it\u2019s too steep for me to get back up. Oh well, it shouldn\u2019t be
    too much of an issue. I haven\u2019t encountered anything dangerous yet, so I
    should probably be fine. I\u2019ll continue through the forest, maybe I\u2019ll
    be able to loop my way back to the ship eventually. Hopefully I can gather a
    bunch of data while I\u2019m at it."
